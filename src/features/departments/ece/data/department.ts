    "tagline": "Embedded systems, signal processing, VLSI design, and telecommunications.",
    "description": [
        "Electronics and Communication Engineering (ECE), deals with the electronic devices, circuits, communication equipment's like transmitter, receiver, integrated circuits (IC). It also deals with basic electronics, analog and digital transmission & reception of data, voice and video (Example AM, FM, DTH), microprocessors, satellite communication, microwave engineering, antenna and wave propagation. It aims to deepen the knowledge and skills of the students on the basic concepts and theories that will equip them in their professional work involving analysis, systems implementation, operation, production, and maintenance of the various applications in the field of Electronics and Communications Engineering.",
        "The objective of this programme is to learn the concepts of electronics and communication disciplines and apply them to solve real world problems in the industry. It emphasizes the design of hardware systems as well as communication systems. The department of ECE is one of the established and largest departments in the institution. Our faculty brings state-of-the-art research, development, and design experience into the classroom, ensuring that our students and alumni are able to apply for registration as professional engineers in all part of global engineering and the scientific community. In all courses the department has built an excellent reputation for its graduates in terms of placements.",
        "The department was established in the year 2008 with Bachelor's degree in Electronics and Communication Engineering and the same is accredited by National Board of Accreditation (NBA). Initially intake into B. Tech program is 60 later in the year 2008 intake has been increased to 120. Department also offers postgraduate programs in the Electronics and Communication Engineering namely Master of Technology. The department has a team of well-qualified, experienced and committed faculty with industrial and research background. They carefully nurture the young engineers and lay down a strong foundation in both technological and analytical aspects. The department has well established Electronics laboratories with state of art facilities. The department uses audio visual teaching aids such as, models, charts and LCD projectors for effective teaching. Students of our department are encouraged to actively participate in technical events and national level paper presentations and few of them got awarded in those events.",
        "Career Prospects: Electronics and Communication Engineering opens up great career prospects for the students. The students after completion of the degree can easily avail job opportunities in manufacturing industries and service organizations such as broadcasting, consulting, data communication, entertainment, research and development; and system support. The candidates can also work in modern multimedia service firms that are involved in real-time transfer of information through video conferencing and internet broadcasting."
